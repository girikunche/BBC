    "### Instructions: Step 2  - Building and Training Models [35 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kaggle competition, the training data has labels (category). Thus, it can be solved using supervised learning. In general, the more labeled data we have, the more accurate the supervised learning model will be. But unsupervised learning can be powerful even when there is a small number of labels or no labels. This assignment will apply an unsupervised approach, especially the matrix factorization method, to discover topics in the news articles and use the labels to check the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some steps to guide this section: \n",
    "1) Think about this and answer: when you train the unsupervised model for matrix factorization, should you include texts (word features) from the test dataset or not as the input matrix? Why or why not?\n",
    "2) Build a model using the matrix factorization method(s) and predict the train and test data labels. Choose any hyperparameter (e.g., number of word features) to begin with.\n",
    "3) Measure the performances on predictions from both train and test datasets. You can use accuracy, confusion matrix, etc., to inspect the performance. You can get accuracy for the test data by submitting the result to Kaggle. \n",
    "4) Change hyperparameter(s) and record the results. We recommend including a summary table and/or graphs.\n",
    "5) Improve the model performance if you can- some ideas may include but are not limited to; using different feature extraction methods, fit models in different subsets of data, ensemble the model prediction results, etc. "
